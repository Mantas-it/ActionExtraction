With respects to a possible reaction mechanism, Friedel-Crafts acylation with carboxylic acid chlorides or anhydrides often occurs through acyl cation intermediates, however amides generally do not produce acyl cations in acidic media.
Nevertheless, amide 4 can be reacted with CF3SO3H (4 equivalents) in CH2Cl2 without an arene nucleophile, and when the mixture is poured over ice, benzoic acid is isolated in 90% yield and no starting amide is found.
This observation is consistent with the formation of either the benzoyl cation or the mixed anhydride with the triflate anion.
